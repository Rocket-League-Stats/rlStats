# Comp 426 Final Project

Current project is comp426-project. rl-stats is my old project and is there as a reference.

To access the project:
    - cd comp426-project
    - npm install 
    - npm run build
    - npm run start

And the project should be hosted to http://localhost:5000/.

Current TODOs:
    - Make pages and components in /src/pages and /src/componenets
    - Organize data in backend
    - Make an authorization for certain pages
    - Incorporate cookies into the website
    - Come up with better methods to calling the Database
    - Also make the README look nicer 

This is the current db im using to access all the data, dm if you need access. When making calls to the db, use this login:

username: host
password: NGNxDF1XwElvEQ0c
uri: mongodb+srv://host:NGNxDF1XwElvEQ0c@cluster0.gbvl6.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/5fa9cf41cc3a6a4e9980f7b6#clusters

An example of this is near the bottom of the /server/app.js file.

Feel free to add changes to individual branches and ask @andrew for questions.
Try to reserve main for only working apps and/or necessary features.
