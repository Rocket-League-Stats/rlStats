# Comp 426 Final Project

Current project is comp426-project. rl-stats is my old project and is there as a reference.

To access the project:
    - cd comp426-project
    - npm install 
    - npm run build
    - npm run start

And the project should be hosted to http://localhost:5000/.

Current TODOs:
    - Make pages and components in /src/pages and /src/componenets
    - Organize data in backend
    - Make an authorization for certain pages
    - Incorporate cookies into the website
    - Come up with better methods to calling the Database


Feel free to add others and ask @andrew for questions.
